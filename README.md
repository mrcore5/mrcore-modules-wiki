## Mrcore Wiki Module

## What Is Mrcore

Mrcore is a set of Laravel and Lumen components used to build various systems.
It is a framework, a development platform and a CMS.  It is a modularized version of Laravel
providing better package development support.  Think of Laravel 4.x workbenches on steroids.

See https://github.com/mrcore5/framework for details and installation instructions.
